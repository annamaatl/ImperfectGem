    I'm a people pleaser and an introvert: the worst possible personality combination. 
I want everyone to like me a long as I don't have to see anyone. 
    Seriously, I love hanging out with people. Introverts are misunderstood. I genuinly love making playdates, meeting new 
people, and building friendships. But I have to make time to regroup, refresh, refocus. An introvert around people is like a 
phone off its charger--it will work happily a certain number of hours, but eventually it will crash. I have to plug back in 
with some downime-alone-time with God. 
    whether you're an introvert or extrovert, we were created to have intimacy with God, 
joy in His presence, and unbroken communication with the Farther. He is the only Well who satisfies. He offers security, love 
overflowing, and peace in the depths of your soul. in His presence, you are made new. When I run to things of the world, even 
good things, to replenish me, I only end up more tired, more spent, less patient, and more irritable. Jesus Himself modeled 
time alone with god. Scripture tells us He withdrew to lonely places to pray to the Father. 
    There is no substitute for this. 
I've found I can go through the motions: read my Bible, listen to a worship song, attend church--and still not actually be 
fully in the presence of God. On the other hand, when I have spent genuine time with God--even a few minutes--I am refreshed 
and energized. I'm reminded of who I am and whose I am. 
    Our culture, often even ministry culture, actively roots against you 
spending time alone with God. It's about doing, working, serving, and pouring yourself out. we're measured by external 
checklists rather than internal transformation. Serving and doing overflow from a heart connected to God, not the other 
way around. Intimacy with Him has to come first. 
    Time with God doesn't accidentally happen. you have to dig your feet in the 
ground and fight for it.Guard it as a sacred time nobody gets to steal from you: not your job, not sleep, not your kids or 
grandkids, not your husband, not TV, not your friends, nothing. 
    If you feel as though you've been rnning on empty, run to God. 
He will satisfy even the busiest person. He will refresh you, He already knows your sin and anxieties, and He is able to 
overcome those things. He will give you wisdom and direction in your life. Real rest is found in His presence alone. 
Rest In Him. 
    "you reveal the path of life to me; in Your presence is abundant joy; in Your right hand are eternal pleasures" (Ps. 16:11). 
                                          满足的源泉 
    在你能找到的各种个性组合里， 我偏偏就是最次的那类； 既好取悦别人， 又无比内向。 换句话说，就那种“企望备受亲睐 还不用跟任何人打照面” 的范儿。 
    真心话， 我其实乐衷扎堆儿。 内向的人常在这点上被误解。
