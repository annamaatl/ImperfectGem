Beautifully Broken
“THE LORD IS NEAR THE BROKENHEARTED”
(Psalm 34:18).

	In Japan, there’s a centuries-old practice with pottery called kintsugi. When a piece of pottery is broken, it isn’t discarded.  Instead, the pieces are carefully mended back together by using seams of gold. The repaired pottery with its golden seams is considered to be even more beautiful and valuable since it has been broken. The golden cracks are seen as part of the life of the object—part of its story, and part of what makes it what it is. The vessel’s beauty comes from its brokenness.
  
	God, our Potter, has the same vision. When our fragile clay vessel cracks or shatters because of a run- in with this hard world, the break is painful. God sees our pain and he grieves with us (John 11:33-36). But it’s as if Romans 8:28 hangs in His potter’s shop. “All things work together for the good of those who love God; those who are called according to His purpose.” There is no hardship, no struggle, that God won’t use for good, that God won’t use to make you more beautiful. 
  
	So, if you’re broken, take heart God is using your brokenness to make you more whole, more captivating, and more holy. No ounce of pain is being wasted. In fact, the more broken you are, the more opportunity there is for God to mend, and thus more seams of gold. And when you’re on the other side of the brokenness, you’ll find that God hasn’t put you together “as good as new.” No, you’ll be better than new. The mended parts of your life story, part of what makes you who you are, and part of what God has used to make you more beautiful. 
  
	The reality is that when you’re finally at home with God in eternity, you won’t have an opportunity to let Him mend. Hearts don’t break in heaven. So while you’re here, hold up your broken pieces to the Potter. Trust that He is not wasting one ounce of your pain. Trust that He sees great beauty in your brokenness. And cling to Him as He works.
	
  Steps of faith
  God, please teach my hurting heart to rest in the truth that You’re using every bit of this brokenness to create something beautiful in me. Ultimately, I know You’re molding me into the image of Jesus, who is the most beautiful of all. Comfort me as You mold me. 

    Deeper Walk
    Isaiah 57:15
	[kjv] 	For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
	 [bbe] 	For this is the word of him who is high and lifted up, whose resting-place is eternal, whose name is Holy: my resting-place is in the high and holy place, and with him who is crushed and poor in spirit, to give life to the spirit of the poor, and to make strong the heart of the crushed.

 





美丽的破碎
—— 耶和华靠近伤心的人（诗篇34:18）

在日本，流传着一种历经几个世纪的古老艺术形式--金缮修复（Kintsugi）。当一件陶瓷物品破碎后，它不会被丢弃，而是用纯金仔细的缝合修复起来。被金粉缝合修复后的瓷器，因为它曾经的残破而在世人眼中显得更加美丽珍贵。瓷器上留下的这一道道金色的裂痕，仿佛是在记录着它的生命，讲述着它的故事，并且成就了它如今的美丽；这美丽正源于它曾经的残缺和破损。

如瓦匠般铸造我们的神，也同样看待我们。我们的一生往往并不一帆风顺，跌跌撞撞的成长令我们脆弱的生命之器裂开来，有时候难免头破血流心如刀割。但神总是清楚的看见我们的痛苦，并且为我们悲叹忧愁为我们哭泣（约翰福音11:33-36），但我们必须谨记罗马书8:28所说，“我晓得万事都互相效力、叫爱神的人得益处、就是按祂旨意被召的人”；没有一丝苦难和挣扎是无益的，神正是通过这些我们所经历的苦难和挣扎使得我们变得更加美丽。

所以，如果你觉得正在被生活的苦难碾成碎片，请你一定要振作起来。因为此时此刻，神正在用这破碎般的痛苦让你变得更加完整迷人和圣洁。你所经历的每一分苦难都不会被浪费。事实上是，你被碾轧得越细碎，神就更多的机会修复你，你的生命中才会被注入更多金子般闪耀而珍贵的品质。当神最终完成了祂的工作后，你会发现神并不仅仅只是让你“宛若新生”，不，这“重生”其实更胜过“新生”。每一道被神粘合起来的裂痕都不会被刻意遗忘，它们是你生命的一部分，它们成就了如今的你，神正是通过它们让你变得更加美丽。

当有一天你获得永生与主同在的时候，你永远不再需要被修复。天堂里不会再有心碎。所以，当你还在尘世间的时候，把我们生命的碎片都交到造物主的手中吧。相信祂不会让我们所受的苦白白浪费，相信祂在我们被碾碎的生命中发现无与伦比的美丽，永不放弃。

心随主愿

神啊，求你让我饱受痛苦的心平息下来，相信你正在用这每一分的伤痛创造我生命中的美。我相信你正按完美耶稣的形象铸造我。求你，铸造我，安抚我。
