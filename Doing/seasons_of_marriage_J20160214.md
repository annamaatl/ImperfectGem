Seasons of marriage
“Do nothing out of rivalry or conceit, but in humility consider others as more important than yourselves.” (Philippians 2:3)
The noise reached peak levels as the snow fell silently. Who could blame the children for their excitement? It was Christmas Eve, and who was going to try to rein them in? After an hour, my husband and I had put the youngest cousin (our daughter) down for bed, and then we snuck into the laundry room for our private (semi-quiet) gift exchange. We were approaching what I hoped was the beginning of the end of a very trying season in our marriage. I was sitting on the washing machine when he said.” I want this next year to be about our marriage.”  I cried when I pulled out Timothy Keller’s book _the meaning of marriage.
Keller says something early on that proved invaluable. “Over the years you will go through seasons in which you have to learn to love a person whom you didn’t marry, who is something of a stranger. You will have to make changes that you don’t want to make, and so will your spouse” (p33-34). This struck a chord because the last few months had seen my husband through a job loss that led to an identity crisis my husband had been someone very different from whom I had married, and I was reeling.
Both of my parents came from counseling backgrounds. They were prolific readers of book like Keller’s that reach biblical perspectives on marriage. I grew up hearing all about what makes a healthy marriage. But living out truth is not the same as knowing it. I had to humble myself and seek the help of a Christian counselor to confront my resentment and untangle our unhealthy habits.
Thinking again of my parents as well as their godly examples of husband and wife, I realized watch of their marriage contained a season (or several) when one or the other was not at their best, yet they were happy! How? Because no matter the season, each had adapted for the other. They strived to do as the Bible teachers: submit to one another and consider the need of your spouse above your own. This is only possible through the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit. It isn’t easy, but it’s necessary if we are going to not only survive in marriage, but thrive. 
Step of faith
Lord, enable us to seek the help we need in our marriages, whatever the season, may our marriages reflect to the world Your glorious example of Christ loving His church.

婚姻的季节
凡事不可结党，不可贪图虚浮的荣耀；只要存心谦卑，各人看别人比自己强。（腓利比书2：3）
外面的大雪稀稀漱漱地打在窗上，更显得屋内的欢声笑语快把房顶撑破。圣诞夜里谁还会督促孩子们早点睡觉？任由他们疯去吧！就这样玩了一个多小时，我和先生俩人终于成功地把最小的孩子放倒在床上，然后偷偷溜进洗衣房，开始专属于我们俩的礼物交换。当下我们正值“七年之痒”，我希望从此刻开始了结我们婚姻的艰苦季节。我坐在洗衣机旁，他手里捧着一份礼物，说道：“我希望来年更专注于我们俩的婚姻。”当我拆开包装纸，看到Timothy Keller的这本《婚姻的意义》时，泪如雨下。
Keller早年就说过一句无数次被证实为金句的一句话：“历经多年，你会学会如何去爱一个你原本不愿意和他/她结婚的人，那个人甚至可以是陌生人。你也会做出你不情愿的改变，而你的配偶也是如此。”这句话真是说到我的心坎里了。过去的几个月，我的先生经历了失业以及身份危机，从而性情大变，与原本的他判若两人。我在一旁经历着他的这些改变也是苦不堪言。
我的父母都做过婚姻咨询师，他们读过很多关于婚姻的书籍，可以从圣经的角度解读婚姻。我从小到大都在耳濡目染如何营造一个健康的婚姻。但懂得道理是一回事，践行出来又是另外一回事。很多时候我都不得不谦卑下来，向基督徒婚姻咨询师寻求帮助，以排解我的怨恨，除去那些不好的习惯。
当我再回头想想我敬虔的父母，我才意识到他们的婚姻其实也经历过高峰和低谷。当其中一个不在状态的时候 ，他们依然可以满有幸福。为什么？因为无论境遇如何，其中一个必然去适应另外一个。他们努力像圣经教导的那样做：彼此顺服，并把对方的需要至于自己的需要之上。做到这一点并不容易，但是我们若想婚姻不仅仅是凑合着过活，而是要在婚姻中得胜，就唯有让圣灵在我们里面做工，别无他法。
心随主愿：
主啊，让我们在婚姻需要帮助的时候可以勇于向圣灵求助，无论婚姻处于何种境地，都让我们的婚姻彰显你的荣耀，就像基督爱 祂的教会那般。
译者心语：
经营婚姻从来就不是一件容易的事情。我看过身边太多的悲欢离合，自己的婚姻也是时而如沐春风, 时而暴风骤雨。但身为基督徒，我们俩如胶似漆也好，剑拔弩张也好，我都从没想过要放弃。因为我笃定神把两个人放在一起就是要我们磨掉自己的棱角，去契合对方的形状，然后我们两个人以一个整体的形象去面对周遭的人事物。
在婚姻里谦卑下来，彼此顺服是我们一生的功课，但最终我们将会收获让神喜悦的婚姻生活。
