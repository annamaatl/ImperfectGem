学会去爱
“爱弟兄，要彼此亲热；恭敬人，要彼此推让。”（罗马书12：10）

我在一个缺乏温情的家庭环境中长大，恶语相加，举止暴力是家常便饭。由于目睹太多人性自私的一面，遇事我总是习惯先保护自己，为自己辩护。可以说这是我从就小学会的生存本能。但是当我步入婚姻生活以后，我发现这种本能给我带来了很多的负能量。

小时候，当父母觉得我做错了事时，我绝不可以为自己辩解。但作为一个新结婚的女人，我终于扬眉吐气，每次吵架都要噎得对方说不出话为止，胜利永远掌握在我手中。我成了一个专业辩手，可以历数丈夫过往的任何“犯罪”细节，并且极尽讥讽之能事，进而享受大获全胜的快感。也就是从那时起，丈夫开始慢慢养成了与我争辩的习惯，我俩棋逢对手，针锋相对，我便更有理由变本加厉地反击，直到夺取最后的胜利。慢慢地，我们俩都变得斗志昂扬，结果却换来了婚姻的恶化。
直到有一天早上，我们刚吵完一架，我恰好听到一个基督广播正在讲述如何修复婚姻。主持人问道：“如果你爱你的配偶，最重要的是什么？是追求正确，还是保持良善？是力争让对方哑口无言，还是尽量宽容对方？”那天早上，神对我说话，让我意识到以往我用恶劣的态度和尖刻的言语中伤了我的丈夫。我不该热衷于在吵架中胜过他，而是应该把同样的热情倾注在如何去爱他。即便他做错了，我也应该给予他足够的爱、尊重与支持。
罗马书12章10节：“爱弟兄，要彼此亲热；恭敬人，要彼此推让。”换句话说，学会爱他人是我们一生的功课。当然，这也许意味着当他又让我心怀不满，或者他粗枝大叶地买来了我们不常用的一个牌子的手纸时，我要学会把责备的话咽下去，换成接纳和鼓励的言语。
当我们的态度屈服于神之后，我们的婚姻关系奇迹般地改善了。每当剑拔弩张之时，我就想想主耶稣，他谦卑地离开天上的宝座，来到地上服侍我们这样的罪人。当我关注于基督时，我会心甘情愿地用爱来沐浴我的丈夫，并且愿意用加倍的爱来爱他。

祷告
主啊，请帮我学会去爱和尊敬我的丈夫，就像你爱我那样。

Learning to Love
“Show family affection to one another with brotherly love. Outdo one another in showing honor.” (Romans 12:10)
I wasn’t raised in an affectionate family environment. Our home often thundered with angry words and violent behavior. As a result, I witnessed a lot of selfishness and became focused on protecting and defensing myself. To some degree, I was exhibiting a natural survival instinct, but as I entered adulthood, it wasn’t a healthy attitude to carry into marriage.
As a child, I was not allowed to provide a defense when my parents felt I had done something wrong. But as a newly married woman, I was determined to have the last word and prove myself right. I became an expert arguer, remembering small details about my husband’s past offenses and making sarcastic comments that filled me with a sense of triumph. Back then, my husband had a habit of starting the arguments, so I felt justified in fighting back until I emerged victories. As the years passed and we became more combative, our marriage deteriorated.
One morning after a spat, I turned in to a Christian radio broadcast about restoring one’s marriage. The host asked, “If you love your spouse, what is most important? Being right or being kind? Having the last word or having a forgiving spirit?” God spoke to my heart that morning that showed me that I was tearing down my husband with any attitude and my words. Instead of wanting to triumph over my spouse in an argument, I should pour the same enthusiasm into loving him. Even if my husband is in the wrong, I should love him enough to back down and treat him with respect and kindness.
Romans 12:10 says: “Show family affection to one another with brotherly love. Outdo one another in showing honor.” In other words, having a lifelong contest to see who can out-love the other person. Maybe that means biting my tongue when my husband is disagreeable or overlooking when he brings home the wrong brand of paper towels.
After surrendering our attitudes to God, my husband and I have seen miraculous improvements in our marriage. When tensions arise, I now look to Jesus, who humbled Himself, left His throne in heaven, and came to earth to serve sinners like me. When my focus is Christ, I find great joy in showering my husband with love and trying to outdo his acts of kindness.

Steps of faith
Lord, help me to love and honor my husband the way You love me.
